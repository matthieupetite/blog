# Good news

Infracost now supports the Azure SQL Managed instance component, so you can benefit in your financial analysis reports from
your terraform projects taking into account the costs related to being composed, but also the associated backups.

First Pull Request in this project for me and first experience with GO and it's an adventure that looks beautiful and very promising...

Looking forward to meeting you for new resources available in the tool.

Happy Terraform

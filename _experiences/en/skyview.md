As Team Leader and Architect of the Industrialization and Rehosting Squad, I am in charge of defining the deployment mode of the baseline of the Skyview product in a Kubernetes infrastructure.

The main challenge of the project is to ensure the rehosting of around ten legacy C++/Java applications by integrating security, safety and supervision issues into a full dev/ops approach. The target being containerization, all applications are reworked to make them compatible with the new hosting mode.

In parallel with the rehosting work, the Industrialization and Rehosting squad is responsible for ensuring the implementation of the dev/ops process to ensure the migration to Kubernetes. The tools used are Ansible, Helm, Bazel mainly all orchestrated in a Jenkins forge.

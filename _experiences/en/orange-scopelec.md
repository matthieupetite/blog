In the production teams of Orange Applications For Business, my first mission is to disseminate the Dev / Ops methodology within the software teams of Orange Business Application and to advise our customers on the implementation of this approach within their own teams.

The topics covered are multiple and range from the capture of requirements to the implementation of software deployment mechanisms (Software and Infra) through issues of source code management, builds, software quality, project management, software quality.

My chosen field is mainly focused on Microsoft technologies and more specifically the Azure Dev Ops software forge (TFS Forge) allowing the orchestration of .Net developments and infrastructure deployments (Azure IaaS, Azure PaaS, Azure CaaS and all types cloud computing provider).

The second part of my activity, more traditional within an ESN such as Orange Application For Business consists in carrying out development projects in the Microsoft ecosystem. As a senior technical leader, I lead a development team by defining technological orientations and production processes, supporting junior developers and ensuring the viability of the quality / cost / time triptych in a Dev / Ops approach. The projects I work on are mainly focused on .Net, Net Core, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure IaaS, Azure PaaS, Adfs.

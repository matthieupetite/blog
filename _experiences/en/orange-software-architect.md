Within the software development teams of the Digital Application division of Orange Applications For Business, I am in charge of carrying out Microsoft projects on behalf of our customers.

My intervention, almost exclusively in result commitment mode, if it was initially limited to development activities, quickly evolved into a position of technical leader.

Technical project manager, my role is to ensure the quality of the delivery on the one hand while respecting the imperatives of cost / quality / deadlines. Responsible for the development team from a technical point of view, I am in charge of leading the technical expertise, technically validating the candidates for employment, and monitoring the trainees.

Within the technical department, I work on software development processes and I participate in the deployment of the Team Foundation Server software Forge within the company.

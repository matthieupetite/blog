5. Be a support for the sales, marketing and pre-sales teams in the construction of technical and commercial proposals and offers

I evolve every day in an exciting technical universe where Terraform, ARM, Bicep, Powershell, .Net, docker, Kubernetes, Git, Azure Devops, Gitlab are mixed, to name only the main tools of my daily life. My pre-sales background as a .Net architect is never far away, which allows me to raise the ambition of supporting customers from start to finish in the migration of their applications to the cloud and their monitoring.

Finally, as the footprint of the company is more than 118 countries, I have the opportunity to share daily with exciting technical teams around the world.

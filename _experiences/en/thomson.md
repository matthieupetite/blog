Thomson Telecom and more particularly the S&S division is largely involved in the fields of Set Top Boxes and television on ADSL. Within this team, I participate in the development and customer deployment of a television platform on ADSL called PeakFrame and more particularly in the development of the portal embedded in the STBs in WEB technology.

During this mission, I was entrusted with the deployment in Kuwait of our IP TV platform. The contract budget is around â‚¬2 million and my mission is to install all the equipment necessary for the operation of the platform within the datacenter and to carry out all of the application setups for the Peakframe offer. . This platform provides the customer with 150 live channels (mainly Showtime satellite package provider), videos on demand, Personal Video Recording network, and flash games (Visiware integration). The platform then consists of 130 DELL 2950 servers, a SAN storage bay, 150 satellite receivers. The data is stored in a SQL Server cluster in failover mode.

In order to validate my double competence in Management, I made the choice to orient myself towards a pre-sales activity by integrating the developed business team of OAB.

Within this team, my activity mainly consisted of responding to calls for tenders for our customers and prospects (public and/or private market). My field of intervention was mainly oriented around Microsoft technologies for fixed-price development projects, but also portal solutions such as Drupal, EzPublish and WordPress.

The pre-belly activity includes the activities of: identifying technical solutions, building response files (Technical and Financial), leading the response team, bid management and client support. As part of this activity, I am responsible for defining the technological solutions, their costs, the project methodologies to be implemented, the financial and commercial part of the proposal in compliance with the constraints of the company.

Starting from an almost nil portfolio in 2011, I manage, at the end of 2015, approximately 4M â‚¬ of invoicing / year with a gross margin of 22%.

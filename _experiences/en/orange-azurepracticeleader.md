On behalf of the Thales group, on a mission for Orange Cloud For Business as Azure Dev/Ops Technical Leader, I am in charge of deploying the azure practice within the Orange group.

The practice aims to:

1. Define deployment and operating practices on the azure hyperscaler
2. To certify the Orange group in its hyperscaler practice (Audit MSP and Azure Advanced Specialization)
3. Support OCB teams in building customer projects to provide technical expertise
4. To be a technical point of contact in support of the pre-sales of the Orange Cloud For Business group

The azure practice supports all the countries of the Orange group with a footprint of 118 countries.

Technical and methodological environments:

- Azure Dev/Ops, IaaS, PaaS,
- Linux, Bash, Docker, Windows, Kubernetes
